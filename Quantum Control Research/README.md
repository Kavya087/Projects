# Quantum Control Using Autler-Townes Effect

## Overview 
This simulation models the energy density of quantum particles as a function of time in order to analyze the effects of a pulsed laser system on the asymmetries of a three-level energy system. This was than simulated with various delta2 values. Once the results were obtained, rho33 (the energy density of the third level in the three-level energy system) was plotted as a funciton of time after the system had reached a steady-state. The intention of this project is to study whether or not it is possible to replicate qubit states with lasers despite any material variations caused by nanoscale defects through the manufacturing process. 

## Results
This code successfully simulated and modeled two-level energy systems. However, when three-level energy systems were modeled, there were some unexpected findings. There finding will be further explored by the rest of the lab group.
