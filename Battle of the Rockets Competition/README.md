# Battle of the Rockets [2019/2020]

## Overview
A group of 10 students and I were tasked with designing a rocket and autonomous rover payload that must survive launch, deployment and landing and perform operations such as soil collection and photography autonomously. I worked on both designing the rover electronics which relied on an Arduino with sensors along with running simulations of a dual-deploy rocket on OpenRocket. As team lead I was also tasked with managing the budget for the project and ensuring proper communication between both subsystems (rocket and rover). Based on our scores on the PDR and CDR, we won first place. 

## COVID19 
Unfortunately due to COVID-19 we were unable to fully integrate this projects. However, we were able to successfully build and test the dual deploy rocket, rover electronics and build the rover.
